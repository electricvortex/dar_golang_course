Fifth lesson map:

1. CLI (Command Line Interface)
2. Building a simple CLI using 'urfave' library
3. CLI's flags and commands
4. Building hello-world like http server using 'gorilla-mux' library

Homework: 
1. Printing directories (enter path to directory from CLI (Terminal)) - CLI should be done using Cobra library instead of urfave.
2. Create simple http server for Book Store (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete).

NOTE: Data for second task should be saved in JSON file, any perform operations also should be done in the same file
